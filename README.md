Academic project

This is a customer credit risk analysis for the Churn dataset.
The analysis has three separate parts:

1) A predictive model to classify the customers as good or bad
2) A Clustering model to cluster the customers into separate groups where customers within the same group are more similar to each other than customers belonging to different groups
3) A Frequent pattern mining analysis to uncover hidden patterns in the data and gain insights
